# SnakeGame

Included in this repo is the code for a snake game created using BRIDGES documentation. The methodology includes using a linked list to create the snake inside heap memory, a class is also included in each node. Here in the class the x and y coordinates are constantly updated with user input and each apple collected by the snake adds one more node to the list. It is also important to note that the main function in my code is ommited from this repo due to account info being included in the BRIDGES function call but rest assured it is only two lines.
