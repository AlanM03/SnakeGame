# SnakeGame

Included in this repo is the code for a snake game created using BRIDGES documentation. The methodology includes using a linked list to create the snake inside heap memory, a class is also included in each node. Here in the class the x and y coordinates are constantly updated with user input and each apple collected by the snake adds one more node to the list. In the case for a golden apple(1/10 chance) the snake gets two nodes added to it. It is also important to note that the main function in my code is ommited from this repo due to account info being included in the BRIDGES function api call but rest assured it is only two lines.


RUNNING: Unfortunately after completing this I found out that only the user who created the project can connect to the game in the BRIDGES website apologies for the inconvenience, attatched is a video of the game in action.
