# SnakeGame

Included in this repo is the code for a snake game created using BRIDGES documentation. The methodology includes using a linked list to create the snake inside heap memory, a class is also included in each node. Here in the class the x and y coordinates are constantly updated with user input and each apple collected by the snake adds one more node to the list.
